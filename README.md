# AES_using_Functions
->The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a symmetric block cipher(Uses same key for both encryption and decryption of digital data)
that encrypts and decrypts 128-bit blocks of data. Standard key lengths of 128, 192, and 256 bits may be used.
It is implemented in VHDL(hardware description language) by using functions.
